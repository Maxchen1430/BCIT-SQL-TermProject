# BCIT Comp 1630 - Relational Database and SQL - Term Project
This repository includes the query used to generate the database required, and my own query to extrapolate the appropriate information from it for the "COMP 1630 - Relational Database and SQL" course in BCIT. The file titled **BCIT_SQL_MyQuery** demonstrates my ability to write queries/codes in SQL to wrangle/manipulate the data sets and produce the necessary insights for data analysis.

For more details, please download and look through the SQL files; to do so, you must first install the necessary software, like *SQL Server Management Studio*.
